===============

Due to security issues in versions of mod_wsgi up to and including version
3.4, it is recommended that version 3.5 or later be used.

Because many Linux distributions still ship ancient out of date versions
which are not supported, it is highly recommended you avoid using packaged
binary versions provided by your Linux distribution. Instead install
mod_wsgi from source code, ensuring you keep up with the most recent
version.
