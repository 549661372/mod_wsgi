Project Status
==============

The mod_wsgi project is still being developed and maintained. The available
time of the sole developer is however limited. As a result, progress may
appear to be slow, or at times not visible at all. Usually it isn't that
changes aren't being made, but that because documentation isn't being
updated, except for the release notes, so you wouldn't know about the
changes.

A lot of the more recent changes are being made with the aim of making
it a lot easier to deploy Apache with mod_wsgi in Docker based
environments. Changes included the ability to install mod_wsgi using
``pip``, along with an admin command called ``mod_wsgi-express`` which
provides a really simple way of starting up Apache and mod_wsgi from the
command line with an automatically generated configuration.

In general, the documentation is in a bit of a mess right now, being
somewhat outdated, but also because it had to be quickly shifted to this
new location from the old Google Code site just prior to it being shutdown.
Some documentation was dropped when that move occurred, so if you can't
find something then ask on the mod_wsgi mailing list for help.
