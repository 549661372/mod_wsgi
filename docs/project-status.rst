Project Status
==============

The mod_wsgi project is still being developed and maintained. The available
time of the sole developer is however limited. As a result, progress may
appear to be slow, or at times not visible at all. Usually it isn't that
changes aren't being made, but that becaused documentation isn't being
updated you wouldn't know about the changes.

A lot of the more recent changes are being made with the aim of making
it a lot easier to deploy Apache with mod_wsgi in Docker based
environments. Changes included the ability to install mod_wsgi using
``pip``, along with an admin command called ``mod_wsgi-express`` which
provides a really simple way of starting up Apache and mod_wsgi from the
command line with an automatically generated configuration.

Completely revised documentation will eventually be incorporated here, but
expect progress to be slow in that area.

In the mean time keep referring to the older documentation located on
the Google Code site at:

    https://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/WhereToGetHelp

The full documentation index on the Google Code site can be found at:

    http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/w/list

Documentation for the new ``mod_wsgi-express`` feature will not be found
on the Google Code site, but is documented in the PyPi entry for mod_wsgi
at:

   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mod_wsgi
